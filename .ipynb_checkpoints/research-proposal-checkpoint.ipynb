    "* In the mid to late 1980's, there was a big push to put a warning label on records and CD's that were deemed 'explicit' and had suggestive or 'satanic' lyrics.  This was supposed to help parents monitor the music their children were buying. I propose it had the opposite effect. The sales of albums and music with explicit lyrics and images was more popular after the mid to late 1980's.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will test this hypothesis by creating different groups of data separated by genre, explicit vs non-explicit, and a combination of both. I will also separate out the 'Top 10' songs, so that I can test the popularity of songs.  The graphs and statistical data will compare these groups before and after an arbritary date (sometime between 1985 and 1990). If songs and albums with explicit lyrics and images (rap, hip-hop, heavy metal, etc.) were more popular than non-explicit songs after a certain year, it would suggest my hypothesis is correct."
